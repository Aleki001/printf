##printf
> This is a  mini-verison of the ```printf``` function found in
> the ```stdio.h``` library in the C programming language. This function allows
> us to print any argument given to the standard output or terminal. This is variadic function
> since it accepts a variable number of arguments and 
> print any combinations of strings, intergers, and other different data types.

### Synopsis
> This repository holds all the code necessary for our custom ```_printf```
> function to run. Our mini-version currently handles conversion specifiers:
> ```c```, ```s```, ```%```, ```d```, ```i```, ```b```, ```o```
